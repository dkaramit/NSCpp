Dear Editor,\\

\noindent
I would like to thank the Referee for accepting the paper without modifications. The Referee's suggestion to consider incorporating a time-varying decay rate in the future is insightful, and I hope to implement it in the next version of the library. Finally, I would like to highlight that setting $\Gamma_\Phi=0$ and corresponds to {\tt TEND=0}.\\

\noindent
Changes made in the revised version:

\begin{itemize}
\item I have included a footnote in page 6 clarifying that{\tt TEND=0} means $\Gamma_\Phi=0$.
\item I have made a minor stylistic change in the first paragraph of Section 3.3 (page 7): {NSCpp/Definitions.mk} $\to$ {\tt NSCpp/Definitions.mk}.
\end{itemize}

Sincerely,

Dimitrios
